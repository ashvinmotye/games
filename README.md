A repository where I host all my created games.

- [Higher Lower](./higher-lower)

A simple JavaScript game I created where ten numbers are randomly generated. The aim is to guess if the next number is higher or lower than the previous one in the list. Two numbers are already displayed and you need to guess from there. A maximum score of 8 can be achieved which might be easy after some time. So, I added a timer so that you can beat your best time if you have reached the top score. Enjoy!
